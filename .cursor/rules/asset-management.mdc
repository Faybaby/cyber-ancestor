# Asset Management Guidelines

## Ancestor Assets

All project assets are managed in the public directory:

- Production Assets: [public/assets/ancestors](mdc:public/assets/ancestors)
  - Contains all ancestor-related assets
  - Special ancestor types in [public/assets/ancestors/special](mdc:public/assets/ancestors/special)
  - Use relative paths from public directory in components

- Distribution Assets: [dist/client/assets/ancestors](mdc:dist/client/assets/ancestors)
  - Generated during build process
  - Do not modify directly

## Asset Guidelines

1. Image Requirements
   - Format: WebP preferred, fallback to PNG
   - Resolution: 512x512px for ancestor portraits
   - Size: < 100KB per image
   - Naming: `{ancestor_type}_{stage}_{variant}.{ext}`

2. Animation Assets
   - Format: Lottie JSON or CSS animations
   - Duration: < 3 seconds for transitions
   - Optimize for performance

3. Sound Effects
   - Format: MP3 (128kbps)
   - Duration: < 5 seconds
   - Volume normalized to -14 LUFS

## Asset Pipeline

1. Development
   - Place all assets in `public/assets`
   - Reference using absolute paths from public root
   - Test with different device sizes

2. Build Process
   - Assets optimized automatically
   - WebP conversion for images
   - Moved to appropriate dist directory

3. Deployment
   - CDN configuration in [wrangler.jsonc](mdc:wrangler.jsonc)
   - Cache policies for static assets
